# Art In Motion - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Initial analysis request: Analyze the current "Art In Motion" application to understand its architecture, features, and current state.

**Project Overview:**
"Art In Motion" is a mobile-first artwork tracking application designed for museum/gallery staff to manage and track artwork locations using QR code scanning. The app interfaces with FileMaker Pro databases to store and retrieve artwork information.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### **Application Architecture:**
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite build system
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components (comprehensive UI library)
- **State Management**: React Query for server state + React Context for global state
- **Backend Integration**: FileMaker Data API for artwork database management
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication with demo mode support
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support (German, English, Czech)

### **Core Features Analysis:**
1. **Authentication System**:
   - Token-based authentication for FileMaker API
   - Demo mode for testing without real backend
   - Session persistence using sessionStorage

2. **QR Code Scanning**:
   - Camera-based QR scanning using jsQR library
   - Mobile-optimized with rear camera preference
   - Validates artwork ID format (ART-12345)
   - 30-second scanning timeout

3. **Artwork Management**:
   - Fetch artwork details by QR code
   - Display artwork information (title, artist, current location, thumbnail)
   - Update artwork locations with hierarchical structure (warehouse > shelf > table > box)
   - Batch processing for multiple artworks

4. **Location Management**:
   - Hierarchical location structure (4 levels deep)
   - Predefined location options for consistency
   - Location formatting for display

5. **Batch Operations**:
   - Queue multiple artworks for batch location updates
   - Visual queue management with add/remove capabilities
   - Bulk update processing with API batching (100 records per batch)

### **Technical Strengths:**
- Modern React architecture with TypeScript
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Comprehensive UI component library
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Internationalization support
- Mock data service for development/testing
- Accessible design patterns

### **Potential Issues Identified:**
1. **Hardcoded API Configuration**: FileMaker API URL and database name are hardcoded
2. **Security**: Token stored in sessionStorage (less secure than httpOnly cookies)
3. **Error Handling**: Some error states could be more descriptive
4. **QR Code Validation**: Limited to specific format (ART-12345)
5. **Camera Permissions**: Limited fallback for camera access failures
6. **Offline Functionality**: No offline support for unstable network conditions
